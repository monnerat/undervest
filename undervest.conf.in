#	Sample configuration file for undervest.


# List of paths where to search data loaders. Default: { @PKGLIBDIR@ }
#loader-path = { /path/to/loaders/directory /other/path/to/loaders/directory }

#	Loging options:
#
#log {
#  Never log with a level inferior to this value. Log messages are not dropped
#  but their level is raised to minlevel if needed. Possible values are
#  emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, information and debug.
#  Default: debug
#	minlevel = error
#
#  Likewise, never log with a level superior to this value. Default: emergency.
#	maxlevel = error
#}

#	SMTP options:
#
#smtp {
#  The SMTP status to return to mail client when a recipient is rejected.
#  Default: 550.
#	status = 551
#
#  The extended status to return to mail client when a recipient is rejected.
#  Default: "5.5.1"
#	extended-status = "5.5.0"
#
#  The textual message reported to the mail client when a recipient is rejected.
#  Default: "User unknown".
#	message = "There's nobody here with this name"
#}

#	Mail domain descriptions:
#  Several domain sections may appear in the configuration. Each domain
# must be named according to the corresponding mail domain. If no domain is
# specified, domain "localhost" is implied.
#  Note about local domain(s): since sendmail determines the validity of a local
# address before calling the filter, the later will properly function only
# if the sendmail configuration file defines LUSER_RELAY to some valid
# address intended to receive all mail sent to an unknown recipient.
# the filter will divert this handling whenever possible.
#
#domain example.com {
#  Enables/disables handling of this domain. Default: true
#	enabled = no
#
#  Fix recipient address when there's no ambiguity with regard of the
#  thresholds. Default: false
#	autofix = yes
#
#  Refresh domain data every n seconds. If 0, data are never refreshed.
#  Default: 0.
#	refresh = 900
#
#  List of retry times in case of failure. Times are expressed in seconds
#  relative to the initial failure. Default: {30, 300}.
#	retries = {}
#
#  Continuous retry period after all listed retry time have been exhausted. Set
#  to 0 to disable. Default: 3600.
#	retry = 1800
#
#  The first fuzzy matching algorithm applied is based on overlapping text
#  slices call n-grams. This parameter allows to specify the maximum slice
#  length. Default is 3.
#	n-gram = 4
#
#  Thresholds options:
#
#	thresholds {
#   Specifies a minimum matching weight for an n-gram fuzzy match to be
#   considered as valid. The value must be positive and <= 1.0. Default: 0.8.
#		n-gram = 0.85
#
#   Word matcher compares non-overlapping full alpha words, and count
#   digits as a single word (to drastically lower scores of addresses with
#   unmatching numerals). This parameter sets the minimum score for such a
#   match to be taken into account. Default: 0.5.
#		word = 0.6
#	}
#
#  Sources:
#
#  For each domain, the filter must obtain the full list of valid recipient
#  addresses. Each source section (i.e.: there can be more than one) describes
#  a source of those addresses. If no source is given, sendmail sources
#  for /etc/passwd and /etc/aliases are implied.
#
#	source {
#   Enables/disables this source. Default: true
#		enabled = no
#
#   Each source must specify a data loader: a module interfacing with the
#   (possible remote) data provider. It is possible to specify a loader as
#   an absolute path to a shared library, a relative (from the loader path
#   directories) path or a name that will be used with the loader paths to
#   build the shared library name. For now, only two loaders are provided:
#   sendmail and ldap. The default is sendmail.
#		loader = ldap
#
#   This parameter is passed to the loader to locate the target data. It
#   should be given as an URI, but a particular loader may restrict
#   its form (i.e.: a file URI for sendmail and an ldap/ldaps URI for ldap).
#   Note about ldap URIs: the bind dn and password may be given in the
#   authority part of the URI; selected attributes MUST be specified and contain
#   e-mail addresses or recipient names. Default: "".
#		uri = 'ldap://binddn:password@ldap.example.com/dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(%7C(mail=*))'
#}


#	Examples:
#
# Local domain.
#
# Note that wildcard recipients are not processed.
# See remark above about LUSER_RELAY.
#
#domain localhost {
#	autofix = yes
#	refresh = 300
#	source {
#		loader = sendmail
#		uri = file:///etc/passwd
#	}
#	source {
#		loader = sendmail
#		uri = file:///etc/aliases
#	}
#}
#
#
# M$ active directory.
#
# Sendmail is supposed to act as a relay to an exchange server.
# Please note an ldap request may be limited on the number of results it can
# return: if so, split a source into two or more and lower their result count
# with more restrictive URIs.
#
#domain example.com {
#	autofix = yes
#	refresh = 900
#	source {
#		loader = ldap
#		uri = 'ldap://ldapuser%40example.com:password@ads.example.com/dc=example,dc=com?proxyAddresses?sub?(proxyAddresses=smtp*)'
#	}
#	source {
#		loader = ldap
#		uri = 'ldap://ldapuser%40example.com:password@ads.example.com/dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(mail=*)'
#	}
#}
